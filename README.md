**Vorcer** was created as a 2D game where the player has to dodge monster and fireballs shot from the monster, collect coins, and reach the flags to advance to the next level. Originally, the plan was to make a survival action game called **Vorcer**, which would focus on the social issue of verbal bullying, a problem that affects many teenagers today. The audience for **Vorcer** was intended to be teens, as they often face challenges related to this issue. However, this current game turned into something different.

## Developer Documentation

### What I intended to create: Vorcer
What I intended to create, was a 2D survival action game that would address the social issue of verbal bullying. The idea was to provide players with a platform to navigate through different environments in the that show different emotional and psychological obstacles bullying can create. The aim was to raise awareness of this issue and show how words can impact a person.

### What I made: Vorcer
When I first started producing my game, I realised my idea was too complicated, so I changed a few aspects of the game such as: 
- **Character Movement**: Smooth player movement using W, A, and D for which W is used for jumping and A and D is used to move left and right
- **Enemy**: Monsters actively shoot at the player, adding difficulty and excitement to the gameplay.
- **Level Progression**: Players should reach the flag at the end of the level, to unlock the next level.
- **Music**: Produced a soundtrack in sountrap for the game, to give a sense of excitement

**Vorcer** was created as an action-packed game where players dodge monsters, collect coins, and capture flags to advance to the next level. Originally, the plan was to make a survival action game called **Vorder**, which would focus on the social issue of verbal bullying, a problem that affects many teenagers today. The audience for **Vorder** was intended to be teens, as they often face challenges related to this issue. However, this current game turned into something different, focusing more on fun, action, and adventure gameplay.

## Developer Documentation

### What I intended to create: Vorcer
What I intended to create, was a survival action game that would address the social issue of verbal bullying. The idea was to provide players with a platform to navigate through different environments in the that show different emotional and psychological obstacles bullying can create. The aim was to raise awareness of this issue and show how words can impact a person.

### What I made: Vorcer
When I first started producing my game, I realised my idea was too complicated, so I changed a few aspects of the game
- **Character Movement**: Smooth player movement using W, A, and D for which W is used for jumping and A and D is used to move left and right
- **Enemy AI**: Monsters actively shoot at the player, adding difficulty and excitement to the gameplay.
- **Level Progression**: Players should reach the flag at the end of the level, to unlock the next level.
- **Physics Engine**: Gravity and physics are used to create realistic jumping and movement dynamics.
